To Do:
=====
1d: Scatter,

2D: Chlorpleths, bivariate chlorpleths, etc


3D: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_partial_dependence.html#id3


QCA for cat/cat,
graphic models for hybrid  
fda for quantative + quantative


My Working Defitiontions:
=========================
Dataset: collection of related information 
Variable: attribute of the dataset 
Observation: entry in the dataset
Measurement: single data point

Independent & Dependent Variables
---------------------------------
Although being able to categorize data as independent or dependent is often taken for granted,
this distinction is crucial for any later analysis. This boils down to: given a set of data,
are they related to each other in a way where one value affects the other?

Independent: These measurements don't affect each other. 
Dependent: These measurements do affect each other. 

Data typically falls into one of two categories:
Quantitative: how much?
Discrete: countable values 
Continuous: any numerical variable with a  technically infinite number of increments 
Qualitative: what kind?
Interviews, Observations, Documents
Categorical: qualitative data that can be sorted into groups

Measurement Scales
------------------
Categorical and quantitative variables are typically measured in the following ways:
Quantitative:
Interval:  difference between values means something quantifiable
Ratio: interval data with a floor
Categorical:
Nominal: names of categories that are mutually exclusive
Ordinal:  values with a natural ordering like best to worst
