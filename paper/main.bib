The ease of computation by hand of the original boxplot had to be sacrificed, as the variations are computer-intensive. Still, the plots were implemented on a desktop personal computer (Apple Macintosh), in a way designed to keep their ease of computation by computer. The result is a dynamic display of densities and summaries.},

By-products of our graphical displays are outlier detection methods for functional data. We compare these new outlier detection methods with existing methods for detecting outliers in functional data, and show that our methods are better able to identify outliers.

	abstract = {We propose the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the univariate boxplot. The key notion is the halfspace location depth of a point relative to a bivariate dataset, which extends the univariate concept of rank. The "depth median" is the deepest location, and it is surrounded by a "bag" containing the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the "fence" (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and {MATLAB} environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several datasets-for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate data.},

	abstract = {The uncertainties associated with climate-change projections for California are unlikely to disappear any time soon, and yet important long-term decisions will be needed to accommodate those potential changes. Projection uncertainties have typically been addressed by analysis of a few scenarios, chosen based on availability or to capture the extreme cases among available projections. However, by focusing on more common projections rather than the most extreme projections (using a new resampling method), new insights into current projections emerge: (1) uncertainties associated with future greenhouse-gas emissions are comparable with the differences among climate models, so that neither source of uncertainties should be neglected or underrepresented; (2) twenty-first century temperature projections spread more, overall, than do precipitation scenarios; (3) projections of extremely wet futures for California are true outliers among current projections; and (4) current projections that are warmest tend, overall, to yield a moderately drier California, while the cooler projections yield a somewhat wetter future. The resampling approach applied in this paper also provides a natural opportunity to objectively incorporate measures of model skill and the likelihoods of various emission scenarios into future assessments.},

One of the easiest and most useful methods is based on the boxplot. This method is particularly appealing since it does not use any outliers in computing spread. Two methods, one by Carling and another by Schwertman and de Silva, adjust the boxplot method for sample size and skewness. In this paper, the two procedures are compared both theoretically and by Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations using both a symmetric distribution and an asymmetric distribution were performed on data sets with none, one, and several outliers. Based on the simulations, the Carling approach is superior in avoiding masking outliers, that is, the Carling method is less likely to overlook an outlier while the Schwertman and de Silva procedure is much better at reducing swamping, that is, misclassifying an observation as an outlier. Carling’s method is to the Schwertman and de Silva procedure as comparisonwise versus experimentwise error rate is for multiple comparisons. The two methods, rather than being competitors, appear to complement each other. Used in tandem they provide the data analyst a more complete prospective for identifying possible outliers.},

We examine these alternatives and their consequences, discuss related background for boxplots (such as the probability that a sample contains one or more outside observations and the average proportion of outside observations in a sample), and offer recommendations that lead to a single standard form of the boxplot.},

Often within the same package one definition will be used to compute a quantile explicitly, while other definitions may be used when producing a boxplot, a probability plot, or a {QQ} plot. We compare the most commonly implemented sample quantile definitions by writing them in a common notation and investigating their motivation and some of their properties. We argue that there is a need to adopt a standard definition for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package. We conclude by recommending that the median-unbiased estimator be used because it has most of the desirable properties of a quantile estimator and can be defined independently of the underlying distribution.},

	abstract = {Clustering techniques for functional data are reviewed. Four groups of clustering algorithms for functional data are proposed. The first group consists of methods working directly on the evaluation points of the curves. The second groups is defined by filtering methods which first approximate the curves into a finite basis of functions and second perform clustering using the basis expansion coefficients. The third groups is composed of methods which perform simultaneously dimensionality reduction of the curves and clustering, leading to functional representation of data depending on clusters. The last group consists of distance-based methods using clustering algorithms based on specific distances for functional data. A software review as well as an illustration of the application of these algorithms on real data are presented.},

	abstract = {The boxplot method (Exploratory Data Analysis, Addison-Wesley, Reading, {MA}, 1977) is a graphically-based method of identifying outliers which is appealing not only in its simplicity but also because it does not use the extreme potential outliers in computing a measure of dispersion. The inner and outer fences are defined in terms of the hinges (or fourths), and therefore are not distorted by a few extreme values. Such distortion could lead to failing to detect some outliers, a problem known as “masking”. A method for determining the probability associated with any fence or observation is proposed based on the cumulative distribution function of the order statistics. This allows the statistician to easily assess, in a probability sense, the degree to which an observation is dissimilar to the majority of the observations. In addition, an adaptation for approximately normal but somewhat asymmetric distributions is suggested.},

	abstract = {The identification of contaminated observations or outliers is an important part of data analysis since such observations can have a profound influence and distort the analysis. One simple graphical method, based on the box-plot, consists of constructing fences. The fences method is not only appealing in its simplicity but more importantly because it does not use the extreme potential outliers which can inflate the computing of a measure of dispersion and hence lessen the sensitivity for identifying outliers. The commonly used fences procedure may be too liberal in some situations and too conservative in others. That is, it sets one criteria for all scenarios and does not afford the data analyst the flexibility of specifying the probability or criterion for designating an observation as an outlier in a variety of circumstances. Furthermore, the most commonly used procedure is a “one size fits all” style and does not incorporate sample size. Unfortunately, a value that is extreme in a small data set might be expected in a much larger sample. In this paper, a method is proposed to include sample size in constructing fences as well as a sequential procedure to identify multiple outliers at a specified probability.},
